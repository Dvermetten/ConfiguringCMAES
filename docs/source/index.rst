   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Modular CMA-ES Framework's documentation!
====================================================


A note from the author
----------------------

This documentation serves as a reference for the structure of this framework.

Please note, this framework is still under development, and no guarantees will
be given on it's correctness of execution. Any modules, classes or functions
currently specified may be renamed, removed, reinvented, rescued, rolled over,
and whatever else turns out to be most useful  for the future of this framework
as a whole.

The files :mod:`EvolvingES` file contains functions related to this framework
that are  remains of experiments performed while this framework was initially
created. I  realise that makes this framework a bit of a mess for now, but it
will get  better... promise!
